To run the tests, you need a copy of the Mercurial source code.  While in the 
kbfiles test directory, run

    python <path to Mercurial source directory>/tests/run-tests.py

For the tests that use Kiln, you need to change the Kiln settings in
custom.py.  Also, you must run at least one operation that involves
interacting with the Kiln server and entering your username and password
so that they are stored in the kilnauth extension prior to running the
tests.
